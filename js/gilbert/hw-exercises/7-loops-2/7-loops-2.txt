1. Create an array of 6 grades, ranging between 0 to 100, but make sure that one of the grades is below 65.
2. Console log "Print of Passing Grades".
3. Create a loop (whatever loop you prefer) to iterate through all the grades, printing all of them out, but if the grade is below 65, then skip it (don't print it).
