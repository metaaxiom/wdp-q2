Below is a classic programming problem. It is famous because virtually everyone learning programming will come across it at some point. Freshman-level Computer Science courses at universities frequently cover it.

Print all the integers from 1 to 100, except that:

1. When the current number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
2. When the current number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
3. When the current number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

The beginning of the output should look like this:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
...and so on
