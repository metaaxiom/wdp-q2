1. Create a string variable that stores a password (it can be anything you like).
2. Use prompt() to ask the user for a password, and store the user's answer in another variable.
3. Using the "if" statement, check whether the password that the user entered matches the actual password.
4. If the password matches, display an alert to the user that they've been allowed to view the website.
5. Else (if the password doesn't match), display a message that the password entered was incorrect.
