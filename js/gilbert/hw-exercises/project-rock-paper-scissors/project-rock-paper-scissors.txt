For this project, we will create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in which a user plays against the computer. The user will pick his choice, but the computer will randomly generate his. Though basic, this game will allow intermediate knowledge of JavaScript (and so, will hopefully be a good learning exercise).


PART 1:
=======

Use HTML & CSS to build a user interface for a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. You're welcome to make it look however you want, so long as the design makes sense and is pleasant to look at.

However, a safe bet that would be easy to work with involves creating three buttons: one for Rock, one for Paper, and one for Scissors. If you'd like, you can spruce these buttons up by adding to them icons of their respective "weapons" (FontAwesome can help with that). Then, somewhere below or above these buttons, we could have space for a box, where the score of the game would be recorded.

Label and position everything accordingly.


PART 2:
=======

Use what you have learned about JavaScript to produce an alert on the screen whenever any of the buttons are clicked. You will require an event listener for this. At this stage, it's important to have all your relevant HTML elements set with the right identifiers (either IDs or classes).


PART 3:
=======

Make it so that the alert always says which of the three buttons was clicked ("Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"). You may find the "value" property useful here.

BONUS: Try to accomplish the above without creating three seperate event listeners (which is inefficient).


PART 4:
=======

Instead of alerting which button was clicked, display it in the score box, which you created in Part 1.

BONUS: Make it so that text written to the score box doesn't override the previous text displayed there, but gets appended to the previous results there, on a next line.
