1. Create an array that stores 5 first names.
2. Create an array that stores 5 last names.
3. Create a loop (it can be either a while or a for loop), to iterate through the first names array.
4. At each iteration of the loop, append a last names to the first name, and console log the result (example: "John Smith"). Make sure that each person has a unique last name.

Example result:

"John Smith"
"Henry Cooper"
"Adam Jones"
"Megan Williams"
"Greg Locke"
