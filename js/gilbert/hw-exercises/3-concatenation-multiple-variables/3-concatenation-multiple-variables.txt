1. Create three string variables, each containing the name of a student (you can make up these names).

2. Create three number variables, each containing a grade, between 0 and 100 (again, you can make up these values).

3. Write three console.log's, each printing a student's name followed by a grade (one line per student). Which name you pair with which grade is up to you.

TIP: Remember that you can use a comma within console.log() to print multiple clauses.

BONUS: Print each line with a colon, in the following format: "Adam: 86"
