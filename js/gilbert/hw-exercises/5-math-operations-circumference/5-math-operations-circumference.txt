JavaScript's Math object provides us with certain properties and functions that come in handy when performing mathematical calculations. One such property, Math.PI, will return the π value to us, accurate to more decimal places than most of us remember (since most of us only remember that PI is around 3.14).

To try out using this property, output Math.PI in the console.

After you verify that it displays a long decimal number, do the below three exercises:


1. Use the PI property to calculate the circumference of a circle. Given the formula C = 2πr, where r = 4, solve for C, replacing "π" with the Math.PI property. Make sure to store this calculation in a variable to that you can later output it. It may also be helpful to give the storing variable a name that's more descriptive than "C" (maybe "circum"?).

2. The above exercise will always give the same result, because we hard-coded the radius value to be 4. So, let's make our circumference formula more dynamic. Create a function called "calcCircum", which accepts one parameter, called "radius", and uses it to find the circumference of a circle through the above formula. It then returns this value. Once you write this function, call it several times, providing different radius values, and console.log() them.

3. Answer the question: does the function that you have written qualify as a "pure" function? (it may be helpful to reference my video on functions)
