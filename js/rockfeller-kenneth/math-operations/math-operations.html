    COMPARISONS
    
    You can think of less than (<), greater than (>), and equal to (==)
    operators as questions: "is x greater than y?"; the answer will either be
    yes (boolean true) or no (boolean false)

        NOTE: the equality operator is a DOUBLE equal sign; we use the singular
        equals (assignment operator) for assigning values to variables. Be
        careful to not mix them up!
    */

    console.log(10 > 5); // is 10 greater than 5? true
    console.log(10 < 5); // is 10 less than 5? false
    console.log(5 > 5); // is 5 greater than 5? false, b/c they're exactly equal
    
    // equality comparison with double equals (==)
    console.log(5 == 5); // is 5 equal to 5? true
    console.log(5 == 4); // is 5 equal to 4? false

    // you can combine less than / greater than with the equality operator
    console.log(5 >= 5); // is 5 greater than OR equal to 5? true (ONLY ONE PART HAS TO BE TRUE)
    console.log(5 <= 5); // is 5 less than or equal to 5? true

    /*
    There's also the triple equals (===) which behaves like the double equals
    except that it also considers the type. Double equals will equate two
    values of different types if it can make a simple type coercion (5 == '5');
    triple equals will not equate values, unless EVERYTHING about them is the same
    (we say that it is "data type sensitive").

    // DOUBLE EQUALS
    console.log(5 == '5'); // true
    console.log(1 == true); // true
    console.log(0 == true); // true

    // TRIPLE EQUALS
    console.log(5 === '5'); // false
    console.log(1 === true); // false


    /*
    We need to understand the difference between operand and operator:
        OPERATOR is the symbol performing a functionality (like adding, concatenating, etc.)
        OPERAND is the value that the operator is acting upon (like a string, number, etc.)

    We can group operators into a few categories:
        Unary operators require only one operand
            Example 1: x++
            Example 2: x-
        Binary operators require two operands
            Example: x + y
    */
    
    // UNARY OPERATOR
    let x = 5;
    x++; // will increment x by one, AFTER this line
    console.log(x); // 5, increment only takes effect here

    let y = 3;
    y--; // will decrement y by one, AFTER this line
    console.log(y); // 2, decrement only takes effect here

    // ++ in front increments IMMEDIATELY, whereas ++ in back increments only on NEXT line
    console.log(++y); // 3

    // BINARY operator b/c it requires TWO operands (x and y)
    console.log(x + y);

    

    /*
    There are also ternary / trinary / tertiary (different words for the same thing) 
    operators. An example of one is the conditional operator:
