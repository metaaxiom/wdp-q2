    <!--
      Observe that #container has collapsed. Normally, its height would be determined
      by the size of its content (#x-btn). But, since #x-btn has been assigned
      position: absolute, it's taken out of the normal webpage "flow",and therefore 
      stops affecting the content space within #container. The end result is that
      #container behaves as if it didn't have any content, causing it to collapse.
