Download Buttons:

The text and the icons are all part of the button tag. You can define the "Apple Store" text as a span, and apply an ID to the icons, to apply a background color and padding on them. You could apply flexbox to position the text and the icons within the button.

For the seperators between the footer links, you can use the pipe character, or you can use border-right.
